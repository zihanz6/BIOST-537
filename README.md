### Project Overview
Bone marrow transplant is a standard treatment for acute leukemia. Recovery following bone marrow
transplantation is a complex process. Prognosis for recovery may depend on risk factors known at the
time of transplantation, such as patient and/or donor age and sex, stage of initial disease, and time from
diagnosis to transplantation. The ultimate prognosis may change as the patient’s post-transplantation
experience unfolds, with the occurrence of events at random times during the recovery process, including
the development of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) and the return of platelet counts to a normal
level. Transplantation can be considered a failure when a patient’s leukemia returns (relapse) or when he
or she dies while in remission.

A multicenter study was conducted to evaluate whether patient and donor characteristics as well as
unfolding clinical events are predictive of death in patients receiving allogeneic marrow transplantation.
All patients enrolled were prepared with a radiation-free conditioning regimen consisting of a combination
of oral Busulfan and intravenous cyclophosphamide. Enrollment took place at four different hospitals in the
US and in Australia. The investigators were interested in whether the following characteristics measured
at the time of transplantation (baseline) were associated with the risk of a negative outcome (death or
relapse): patient age and sex, donor age and sex, patient and donor cytomegalovirus (CMV) immune
status, the wait time from diagnosis to transplantation, disease group, French-American-British (FAB)
classification based on standard morphological criteria, and prophylactic use of methotrexate to prevent
aGVHD. A total of 137 patients were enrolled between March 1, 1984 and June 30, 1989. Patients were
followed until death or end of the study.
